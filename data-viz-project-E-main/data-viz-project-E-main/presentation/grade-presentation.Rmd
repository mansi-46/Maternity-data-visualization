## Comments

Great background information for your presentation. Some questions were a bit vague -- you looked at smoking and what other factors?

Some figures, e.g., PCA, were hard to read. The premie + smoking figure was quite complicated and not easy to learn from.

Your conclusions were overly complicated and didn't give an easy to digest answer to your questions.
