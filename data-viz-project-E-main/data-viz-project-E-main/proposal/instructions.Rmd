The purpose of your project proposal is to get your team thinking about data, questions to be investigated, and possible visualizations to use in your analysis.

For your proposal

* revise the template `proposal.Rmd`,
* include a copy of your data in the folder `data` in this repository,
* knit your proposal to html, and 
* commit your changes and push them to github.

I will use the file "grade-proposal.Rmd" to assess your work and provide feedback on your plan. You are free to change any aspect of your proposal (questions, data, visualizations) while you work on your project.
